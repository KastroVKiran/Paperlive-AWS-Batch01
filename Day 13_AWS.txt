Topics:
1. NACL Vs SG
2. Route 53

NACL - Network Access Control List
NACL will work at Instance level, Subnet level
Security Groups works at security level i.e Resource level
For every network, NACL and SG acts as basic firewalls
Since NACL is going to work at subnet level, whatever resources that are launched in the subnet level, for all those resources NACL applies automatically.
NACL are stateless in nature.
SG are statefull in nature

Inbound traffic - is where the request goes from user to the server
Outbound traffic - is where the response from server to user

In NACL and SG both inbound rules and outbound rules should be there

For one EC2 instance, we can attach 5 different SGs
In each SG, we can have a maximum of 60 rules

For 1 subnet, we can attach only 1 NACL

In SG, we can create only "Allow" rules
In NACL, we can create both "Allow" and "Deny" rules

EC2 instance ---- SG ---- Security layer ---- An additional layer of security is NACL



Request --- EC2 instance
Request --- NACL --- Subnets --- SG

If the request makes it through the i/b rules of SG and makes it to the VM, the VM will then reply with whatever there is to do with the app. And then the o/b rule is automatically going to be accepted at SG level. It is because stateful ness of SG\
This means whatever is accepted to go inside they can also go out

But in NACL, since it is stateless, NACL o/b rules are going to be evaluated and if they are not passing then the request will not make it through

ROUTE 53
----------------
Route 53 is DNS service in AWS
DNS - Domain Name System
53 is the DNS port number
In Route 53 we will create records
	LB ---- DNS URL ----- Lengthy URL ----- We can customize the lengthy URL or IP address in a shortest way possible
Lets say we have a browser. Any browser requires 2 things, 1) Hostname 2) IP address

From the browser the request will go to local DNS. From local DNS the request will go to RNS (Root Name Server). From RNS the request goes to TLD (Top Level Domain). From TLD the request goes to Name Server. From Name Server the request goes to SOA

DNS  keeps all the host names and IP addresses. DNS also convert host name to IP address and IP address to host name

To know the IP address of any website we will use "nslookup" command

In route 53 we need to configure only Name Server and SOA. Route 53 will take care of Local DNS, RNS, TLD internally
Route 53 is a global service

Route 53 features;
1. Domain registration --- we can purchase domain using Route 53
2. DNS routing
3. Health checks
4. Routing policies

DNS is all about records
In Route 53 the very first thing we have to do is to create a Hosted Zone. This Hosted Zone contains Records. Hosted Zone is a container of records.
The name of the hosted zone that we should create is the Domain Name
Hosted Zone and Domain Name (.com, .edu, .in...) are same

Types of Hosted Zones;
1. Public HZ - websites will be available on internet - generally preferred
2. Private HZ - if you want to access WEBSITE within the network (VPC), we will use Private HZ

Hosted Zone contains records
	Ex: www.kastro.com ---- lengthy URL of LB i.e DNS URL ---- from ELB the request will be forwarded to EC2 instance. Inside VMs we have our app

Browser --- Kastro.com --- Route 53 --- Hosted Zone --- Records --- ELB URL ---- VMs

Whenever we create a public hosted zone, 2 records will be created automatically;
	1. Name Space Record - it is a pool of servers
	2. SOA Record - Admin for Hosted Zone. It has IP address

NS and SOA records shouldn't be deleted.

Route 53 Record types;
1. A Record
2. AAAA Record
3. CNAME Record
4. Alias Record
5. MX Record

Most commonly used record is a combination of A record and Alias Record
C Name Records are billable, Alias records are free
Always chose Alias Record over CNAME record

Routing Policies;
Kastro.com --- Route 53 --- Hosted Zone ---- LB DNS URL --- VMs
1. Simple Routing Policy --- no health checks
2. Failover Routing Policy --- health checks
3. Geolocation Routing Policy --- R53 identifies users/requests location automatically and divert the traffic to the correct record
4. Latency Based Routing Policy ---request get connected based on the latency
5. Multi Value Routing Policy --- similar to Simple Route Policy but MVRP will perform health checks
