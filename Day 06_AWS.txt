5. AMI Vs Snapshots
6. EC2 Placement Groups
7. Connecting to VM using Sessions Manager*
8. How to attach an Elastic IP to VM
9. Creation of VM using Snapshots

Elastic IP:
When we stop the instance and restart the same instance, the public IP address of the instance will get changed everytime when we stop and restart the instance.
I dont want the Public IP address to get changed whenever i stop and restart the instance. For this we will use Elastic IP.
Elastic IP is billable.

AMI
--------------
AMI is a master image for the creation of virtual servers.
AMIs are templates that are configured with an OS and other software that determine the user's operating environment. 
AMI is an backup of the instance.

Types of AMIs
1. AMI created by the root user
2. Community AMI - when an AMI is created and shared with other AWS users, it comes under community AMI. These AMI are not verified by AWS
3. Market place - Its a service offered by AWS where software vendors sell their products using AWS. These AMIs are verified by AWS

Creation of AMI from EC2 Instance
	VM ----> Git is installed ----> Create AMI from the VM ----> Using the AMI, launch VM ----> Verify for git in the newly launched instance


3. Storage Formats in AWS
-----------------------------------------
1. File level storage
	1.1. EFS - for Linux OS
	1.2. FSx - for Windows OS
2. Block level storage
	2.1. EBS - Elastic Block Storage
3. Object level storage
	3.1. S3

For every instance we will launch, we need to attach a storage device. That storage device is known as EBS Volume.
EC2 and EBS are independent. They both are connected by a network.
When we want a persistent storage we will use EBS.
	Persistent is nothing but data shouldn't get deleted and stores for longer time
'Instance store' is also called as temporary storage
'EBS Volume' is also called as persistent storage
For one EC2 instance, a total of 16 EBS volumes can be attached
1 EBS volume can also be connected to multiple instances using a concept called EBS Multi-attach
EBS is based on AZ.
If an EBS volume is created in any AZ, AWS will create a copy/clone of the EBS volumes.
	Original volume ----> Clone1 ---> Clone2 ---> Clone3
The original volume which is attached to an instance is called as ROOT VOLUME
EBS Volumes are something which are created additionally.

Types of EBS volumes
-----------------------------
1. SSD -----> Better performance
2. HDD -----> Slow performance
3. Previous generation

The data which is accessed frequently, then we will use SSD
SSD is majorly used when we have less data which is accessed frequently.
The advantage of using SSD is the SSD disk functions based on IOPS
	IOPS - Input Output Per Second
HDD is used when we have large data but it is accessed less frequently
HDD functions base don 'Throughput' MBPS or GBPS

Types of SSD;
1. General purpose
2. Provisioned IOPS

When there is a normal usage then we will select general purpose. By default it will come when we are launching an instance
When there is a rapid access of data then we select provisioned IOPS

In general purpose we have 2 types; 1. GP2, 2. GP3
GP2 - Min of 100 IOPS/minute, Max of 16000 IOPS/minute
GP3 - Min of 3000 IOPS/minute, Max of 16000 IOPS/minute

Provisioned IOPS is of 3 types; 1. io1, 2. io2, 3. io2 block express (supported by R5B instance type)
io1 - Min of 100 IOPS/minute, Max of 64000 IOPS/minute
io2 - Min of 3000 IOPS/minute, Max of 64000 IOPS/minute
io2 block express - >= 64000 IOPS

Note: io1 and io2 are only available for Nitro based instances. For XEN, Max of 32000 IOPS/minute

1. Protecting the EBS volumes against the deletion when we are terminating the instance
2. How to attach a new EBS volume to an existing VM
3. How to detach an EBS volume from an existing VM
4. How to delete an EBS Volume
5. How to increase EBS volume size which is already attached to the VM
6. EBS Multi-attach
	1. Create 3 instances
	2. Create 1 EBS Volume
	3. Attach the same volume to multiple VMs

Snapshot - The backup of EBS volume is called as snapshot
Snapshots are taken as incremental

EBS --- 10 GB data --- Complete backup
1 GB extra ---- incremental backup
2 GB extra ---- incremental backup
EBS Volume Size = 100 GB

A snapshot takes a copy of EBS volume and it is stored redundantly in multiple AZs


EC2 Placement Groups
Placement groups are logical grouping of instance in the selected AWS region
Placement group strategies;
1. Cluster - group all instances to low latency group in single AZ
2. Spread - it places a small group f instances across distinct underlying hardware
3. Partition - It spreads instances across many different partitions within AZ
