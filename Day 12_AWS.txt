Topics:
1. VPC Peering
2. VPC Flow logs

VPC Peering is nothing but, 

VPC 1 ----- VPC 2
Peering connection is established b/w two or more VPCs in the same region or different region or different account
When we want to connect one VPC with another VPC privately, then we will use Peering concept

VPC Peering can be made in 3 ways;
1. Peering can be done in the VPCs available same region
2. Peering can be done in the VPCs available in different regions
3. Peering can be done b/w the VPCs available in different accounts

2. VPC Flow logs
Additional cost
To know who is accessing the network then we will use VPC Flow logs
Flow logs can be enabled in 3 levels;
	1. VPC level		2. Subnet level		3.ENIs (Elastic Network Interface)
All the logs will be analyzed using an AWS Service known as Guard Duty. If we just enable Guard Duty and send the VPC Flowlogs to it, it will do the analysis and thus it helps us to take necessary action.
Flowlogs can capture ACCEPTED, REJECTED, ALL
All logs can be published either in S3 Bucket or CloudWatchLogs
To hare the logs to 3rd party services (Splunk, Sumologic) we will use AWS Kinesis Firehouse
What kind of information will we be getting through Flowlogs;
sourceIP, Destination IP, Packet Size, Source Port, Destination Port, Call is accepted/rejected
Flow logs will come every 1 minute or every 10 min
Be default we will get flowlogs for every 10 minutes
